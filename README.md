This project is meant to automatize the attribution of all the rented items in the inventory of our Ski Association. 

I gather a Google Sheet from a Google Form template that I created. This sheet is then downloaded in csv.
The inventory is also joined to the files as a csv file.

The python code is generating a exit xlsx file that resume the attribution of Ski, Boots and Helmets.
It has to respect the ranking of the Google Form template, the ski-level specified in the answers, the height range...

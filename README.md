This project is meant to automatize the attribution of all the rented items in the inventory of our Ski Association. 

I gather a Google Sheet from a Google Form template that I created. This sheet is then downloaded in csv.
The inventory is also joined to the files as a csv file.

The python code is generating an exit xlsx file that sums up the attribution of Skis, Boots and Helmets.
It has to respect the ranking of the Google Form template, the ski-level specified in the answers, the height ranges...
